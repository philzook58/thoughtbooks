    "If we can approximate the indicator function (the function that is 1 on the region of interest and 0 elsewhere), then we're good.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is some chicken and egg problem here. The whole reason we're doing all this is because the region is hard to handle in some way. Many function approximation methods require integration of functions in order to set up the problem.\n",

    "We have an implicit representation of the region. A system of inequalities. If linear, it's a polyhedra. If polynomial its a semi agebraic set.\n",

    "We get by this problem because the indicator function is kind of a sharp logical boy. We can encode it as constraints.\n",

    "The first condition is a positive polynomial condition. The second can be achieved by  i(x) + lam g >= 1 (module getting the signs right). The third condition can by achived by integrating the individual polynomials on a known reference area. Then this is a linear objective in tyhe cofficients of our indicatro approximation $ i(x) =  \\sum a_j x^j$ . $ \\int dx i(x) = \\sum_j a_j \\int x^j dx = \\sum a_j c_j$\n",
